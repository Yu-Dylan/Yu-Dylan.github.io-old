      <h1>Online Classes</h1>
      Over the break, I had more time to reflect on how I learned math and science, and realized that by creating a club to help elementary and middle schoolers during COVID-19, I could help many eager students learn more about mathematics. With other students, I created the Online Classes Club and accompanied by my classmates we reached 117 students in the first Online Classes session (which lasted around a week). The second Online Classes session is taking place now (as of 05/03/20), so join <a href="https://tinyurl.com/onlineclasses123">here</a>!

      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <h3>05/17/20</h3>
      We have two new teachers - Rushil and Caleb! I am extremely happy they have time to help out! Rushil will be teaching Introduction to Algebra I, and Caleb will be teaching Introduction to Geometry. My hope is by offering these classes, students will be able to do well not only in these classes but also improve in competitions. Click the signup link (listed above) to join! 
      </div>
      <h3>05/05/20</h3>
      Next week (05/11/20 - 05/15/20), there will be <b>no sessions</b> due to AP testing. I would also like to announce another instructor, Caleb, will be joining our group! We will work out the details after AP testing to see what he will teach and other complications. Stay safe everyone!
