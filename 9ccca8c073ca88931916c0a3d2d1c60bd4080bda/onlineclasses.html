      <h1>Online Classes</h1>
      <span class="red">(New!)</span> The <b>official</b> site for Online Classes is located <a href="http://onlineclassesclub.weebly.com/">here</a>. Over the break, I had more time to reflect on how I learned math and science, and realized that by creating a club to help elementary and middle schoolers during COVID-19, I could help many eager students learn more about mathematics. With other students, I created the Online Classes Club and accompanied by my classmates we reached 117 students in the first Online Classes session (which lasted around a week). The second Online Classes session is taking place now (as of 05/03/20), so join <a href="https://tinyurl.com/onlineclasses123">here</a>!
      <h2>Handouts</h2>
      Note that these are only <b>my</b> handouts; other teachers will put their handouts elsewhere.
      <h3>Math Level 2</h3>

        An introduction to equation solving and algebraic manipulations (including Egyptian fractions, quadratics, etc.).
        <li>Basic Analytic Geometry (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_Handouts Day 3.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        An introduction to coordinates and graphing.
        <li>More Analytic Geometry (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_Handouts Day 4.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        An introduction to coordinate bashing and a few formulas in analytic goemetry.
        <li>Basic Counting Techniques (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_Handouts Day 5.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        The basics of  counting (including permutations, combinations. etc.).
        <li>Basic Number Theory (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_Handouts Day 6.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        An introduction to number theory (including modular arithmetic, bases, etc.).
      </ol>
      <h3>Math Level 2.5</h3>	

      <ol>
        <li>Online Classes Introduction (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/online-classes-info"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        An introduction to Online Classes (including a list of topics and a short piece on COVID-19).
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Weeks 1-4 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Week_1_to_4.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        These are the combined PDFs of the handouts from Week 1 to 4. Week 1 covered Stars and Bars, Week 2 covered Counting Tricks and Probability, Week 3 covered Basic Geometry, and Week 4 covered Basic Trigonometry and Mass Points.
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 5 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts___Week_5.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered overcounting (and also undercounting). By adding cases that weren't counted and subtracting cases that were, we can solve many contest problems!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 6 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Counting_Tricks_and_Geometric_Probability.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered a few counting tricks and geometric probability. 
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 7 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Units_Digit.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered a portion of number theory regarding units digits. While there aren't many formulas needed, make sure to do any problems we do not cover in class because the problems are good exercises.
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 8 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Linear_Congruences.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we covered a portion of number theory regarding linear congruences. The questions start off simple, but get harder towards the end, so make sure to do any problems we do not cover in class because the problems are good exercises!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 9-11 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Number_Theory_Basics.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        This week we took a step back and covered a few number theory basics. The language I use to code the handouts, TeX, allows me to switch up the style of the handouts, so I decided to make it look a little different to emphasize important points. This week is a little easier than normal, in order to aid those who are inexperienced with number theory. That being said, for those who don't knonw these topics, please do the problems at the end! 
        We used this same handout for Week 10, because we didn't finish all the material in Week 9. Of course, still attempt the problems!
        <li>Math Level 2.5 Handouts Week 11 (<a href="Handouts/Math_Level_2_5_Handouts__Stars_and_Bars.pdf"><div class="twoltip">PDF Version<span class="tooltiptext"></span></div></a>)</li>
        In addition to finishing up last week's handout, we also went over Stars and Bars. This is a VERY important topic, so make sure to answer the problems at the end!
      </ol>
      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <h3>05/17/20</h3>
      We have two new teachers - Rushil and Caleb! I am extremely happy they have time to help out! Rushil will be teaching Introduction to Algebra I, and Caleb will be teaching Introduction to Geometry. My hope is by offering these classes, students will be able to do well not only in these classes but also improve in competitions. We also have new writers, Sahil and Viraj, who will be help in writing handouts! Click the signup link (listed above) to join! 
      
      <h3>05/05/20</h3>
      Next week (05/11/20 - 05/15/20), there will be <b>no sessions</b> due to AP testing. I would also like to announce another instructor, Caleb, will be joining our group! We will work out the details after AP testing to see what he will teach and other complications. Stay safe everyone!
